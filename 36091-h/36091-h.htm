<p class="p4 center">PREFACE</p>

<p class="p2">"Give me the making of a nation's songs, and let who will
make their laws," was the maxim of a Scottish patriot. We would prefer
to modify this rule, and say, "Give us the poems which the people make
for themselves, and then we shall obtain a clear insight into the
national character and learn what customs and laws they are likely to
accept or reject." Folk-songs are the intimate expressions of the ideas
of the people. What the comic drama is to the cultured, and the
music-hall to the ill-educated portions of urban population, the popular
song has been, and in some countries still is, to the rural peasantry, a
true exponent of their sentiments, though too frequently inaccurate in
statements of facts. Critics, as is well known, have censured Lord
Macaulay for his indiscriminate adoption of the vulgar and often
malignant rhapsodies sung in the streets of London. But the Russian
<i>bylina</i>, collected by Danilov, Rybnikov, Sreznevsky and others,
may be taken as furnishing unimpeachable evidence of the state of Russia
during the invasions of the Mongols and Turks. The Jacobite poems give
us the real feelings of the people of Scotland for nearly an entire
century. The popular and rustic strains which are handed down from the
reign of Henry III have rehabilitated the memory of Simon de Montfort.
Moore's Irish melodies, originally composed for the delectation of
English aristocrats, have been so generally admired in his native land
that they exhibit pretty clear indications of what the Irish patriots
would like to do if they had the power. And the battle-hymn by Rouget de
Lisle is not only popular in France, but has recently been sung by the
Russian bolsheviki when marching to occupy Tsarskoe Selo and other
imperial lands.</p>

<p>The songs to which the English form has been given in the following
volume have been taken mostly from Vuk Karad&#382;i&#263;'s invaluable
collection: <i>Srpske Narodne Pjesme</i> (Serbian National Songs).
Karad&#382;i&#263;, of whom the literary world has heard so much, is the
father of modern Serbian literature. He spent many years among the
peasants in collecting the national treasures: ballads, tales, proverbs,
anecdotes and other folklore. Before his time the songs had never been
reduced to written form, and were kept out of reach of the public ear.
He was only able to hear them partly because of a ruse and partly in
secret, when he listened with inexhaustible patience to the girls
spinning, or the <i>guslars</i> (bards) trolling in taverns and at
fairs, or the reapers chanting at their work. In the preface of his
first book of <i>Srpske Narodne Pjesme</i> Karad&#382;i&#263; tells us
that in Serbia two sorts of popular poetry exist&mdash;the historical
ballads, and popular songs of a character which caused them to be
described as <i>&#382;enske pjesme</i> (women's songs) chanted by
country folk, both men and women and mostly in duet. It is the latter,
<i>&#382;enske pjesme</i>, which having been translated into English are
gathered together in the following anthology, <i>Serbian Lyrics</i>.</p>

<p>Sir John Bowring, who unveiled to his countrymen the rich treasures
of Slavic popular songs in general, is also distinguished by being the
pioneer to point out the Serbian in particular. But the claims, which
we, at the present day, feel ourselves entitled to make on a translator,
are very different from those current in Bowring's time. Correctness and
fidelity are now considered necessary requisites in a good translation,
just as antiquarian exactness is expected in the publication of an old
manuscript.</p>

<p>Jugoslav lyric poetry is divided into several groups, as, for
instance, one grouping contains poems concerning marriage. These songs
tell of the beauty of the bride, of her joy and sorrow before departure
from the home of her parents, as well as her feelings upon other
occasions during wedlock. There are poems belonging to the group of
bacchanalian songs, pronounced during the toast, and resounding with
many refrains. Then there are lamentations (<i>tu&#382;balice</i>) which
are mostly provincial, from Montenegro and Dalmatia. They are also
accompanied by refrains, expressing sorrow after the death of some loved
one, and extolling the virtues of the deceased, or the great misfortune
felt by those left behind. All this emotion is described very fitly and
in a touching manner. Further, there are poems commemorating the holy
seasons and "red-letter days," as <i>sve&#269;arske pjesme</i> sung on the
<i>Slava</i> celebration of some <i>svetac</i> (saint). To the same
grouping belong Christmas poems hailing the glory of the Christ, and
depicting the customs of that season (<i>koledo</i>). Saints, such as
Sts. John, George, Peter, and others, have their own eulogies. There are
besides poems exalting the Holy Ghost (<i>kralji&#269;ke pjesme</i>).
<i>Dodole</i>, which originated from old customs of heathenism, are sung
during the summer droughts. Others are reapers' songs, mostly sung at
<i>prelo</i> time (social gatherings). There are poems that are
connected neither with marriage, nor death, nor harvests, but which
treat of mythological or religious subjects; they are called
<i>pobo&#382;ne</i>, describing the spiritual virtues of the Virgin, or
the Christ, or the apostles. Here are also to be found humoristic and
satirical compositions, directed against women, or especially against
monks, widows, and old bachelors. They are as a rule sprightly songs and
piquant, pleasant and witty.</p>

<p>Critics who have written of the Serbian national songs declare that
they are characterized by extreme delicacy both of feeling and
workmanship, and that they are noble in their childlike purity, simple
treatment of, and sympathy with, every phase of natural human
experience. But these Serbian songs have quite a peculiar character of
their own. They are directly, passionately, fiercely human, and rich
with poetic sympathy. Love, glory, sorrow, death&mdash;are the themes
constantly handled in a thousand weird and poetic phrases. There is a
strong Indian flavor of the joy of rest in Mother Earth; and again, a
keen thirst for the fight which smacks of the men who lived with Moslems
around them. Although these chants occasionally recall something of the
martial lilt of old Spanish ballads, they have an individual original
turn which cannot be compared with any extant popular poetry. They have
the uncanny mystery of the Celtic tales of love in death, which is very
rare.</p>

<p>The love songs of the Jugoslav lands have a dreamy, calm and exalted
sweetness that reminds us of the Alps and the Cevennes. Among these the
Bosnian <i>sevdalinke</i> (love songs of Bosnia) are especially worthy
of remark, for they are full of emotion, yearning and tender passion.
The greater warmth of the songs of Herzegovina and Montenegro is owing
more to the sonorous language than to any superiority in melody. Here
are mostly to be found <i>tu&#382;balice</i>. As to Dalmatia, Croatia
and Slovenia, their melodies are chiefly marked by simplicity and a
feeling for the domestic side of life. Ba&#269;ka and Banat, blessed with
much open air and sunshine, possess no love-songs in the strict sense of
the term; but they have <i>serenade</i> and <i>posko&#269;ice</i>,
although for these there is little or no original melody. To the
light-minded and bright-witted singers of these provinces imagination is
easier than memory.</p>

<p>A country very rich in melody is Serbia. Here one may find a truer
and more intense musical feeling, a stronger love of the soil, and more
sincere devotion to the beauty of nature, especially of spring and
summer, than in any other part of Jugoslavia. The love songs of Serbia
seem to have a special inspiration of their own. We may hear the
shepherds singing in green pastures and among the fir-woods, or in the
silence of the mountains. From the vineyards, from the fair and dances,
and from the daily round of work the strains arise. Everywhere that
youth is seen a poem is heard, and every occupation is accompanied by a
song.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, leave this part of our subject without mentioning
some of the burlesque poems, which the Jugoslavs possess in great
number, partly narrative and partly lyric. The Americans are accustomed
to think of the Jugoslavs and their kinsmen as grave and sombre, or,
when their passions are excited, prone to deeds of tragic violence.
Those who are better acquainted with them know full well that they are
as loquacious and sarcastically sportive in their social gatherings as
any nation, and many of their verses are redolent of these qualities.
They display all the gradations of the comic, from the diverting
simplicity of the innocent confession of an enamoured girl, together
with the ludicrous situation and disappointed vanity of her cheated
lover, up to a strain of bitter satire and merciless irony. Poems marked
by that simplicity which borders between the touching and the humorous
are also represented in this volume. Such is the song, "Trouble with the
Husband":</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I married last year,</span>
<span class="i0">This year I repent.</span>
<span class="i0">Bad husband have I,</span>
<span class="i0">With temper like nettle:</span>
<span class="i0">My lot I resent.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The frost kills the nettle,</span>
<span class="i0">But this husband of mine,</span>
<span class="i0">He thinks the frost fine:</span>
<span class="i0">By the stove all day long</span>
<span class="i0">He does nothing but sit,</span>
<span class="i0">And says that the frost</span>
<span class="i0">He minds not one bit!</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In Celovec 'tis market-day,</span>
<span class="i0">'Tis market-day to-morrow;</span>
<span class="i0">I will take my husband there,</span>
<span class="i0">And will either there him change,</span>
<span class="i0">Or else will sell him at the fair.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not too cheap I'll let him go,</span>
<span class="i0">Because he was so hard to get;</span>
<span class="i0">Rather than too cheaply sell him,</span>
<span class="i0">Back home again I'll take the man,</span>
<span class="i0">And love him&mdash;howsomuch I can!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The western world has already heard of the rich mine of Jugoslav
folk-literature. Nevertheless, comparatively speaking, only a very small
number have been translated into English. The extreme simplicity of
these verses, the peculiar character of the Serbian language, with its
melodiously protracted words, its pompously sonorous sounds, and its
harmonious diffuseness, all render it exceedingly difficult to translate
Serbian lyrics without encountering the danger of making constant
additions; especially when rendering it into a language with so many
monosyllabic words, and so philosophically condensed, as the
English.</p>

<span class="i0">I heard a sprightly swallow say</span>

<span class="i0">"Thou art a happy bird indeed;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou dost not in the chimney breed,</span>

<span class="i0">Cursing themselves, and others cursing."</span>
<span class="i0">A young step-sister once I saw,</span>

<span class="i0">"Perdition's daughter! hence depart;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast no fruit beneath thy heart."</span>
<span class="i0">And thus the elder one replied:</span>
<span class="i0">"Curse thy perverseness and thy pride!</span>
<span class="i0">Mihailo is a son of thine;</span>
<span class="i0">Now thou shalt bring forth daughters nine,</span>
<span class="i0">And madness shall their portion be.</span>
<span class="i0">Thy son shall cross the parting sea;</span>
<span class="i0">He never shall return to thee,</span>
<span class="i0">But, bathed in blood and wounded, pine!"</span>

<span class="i0">Her sister's nine fair daughters grew;</span>

<span class="i0">Mihailo,&mdash;far away, and wounded,</span>
<span class="i0">By solitude and woe surrounded,</span>
<span class="i0">I heard him on his mother call:</span>
<span class="i0">"O mother! mother! send me now</span>
<span class="i0">A bandage of that snowy linen</span>
<span class="i0">Which you so thoughtlessly were spinning,</span>
<span class="i0">When curses wander'd to and fro.</span>
<span class="i0">In your rage you wove it,&mdash;now remove it;</span>
<span class="i0">Tear it for bandages, as you tore</span>
<span class="i0">Love and affection all asunder.</span>
<span class="i0">Where it was bleach'd thy son lies under;</span>
<span class="i0">With it cover his hot wounds o'er.</span>
<span class="i0">Rend it, mother; and send it, mother!</span>
<span class="i0">May it thy suffering son restore!"</span>

This song as also those signed "S. J. B." has been transversified and
published by (Sir) John Bowring, "Servian Popular Poetry," London,
1827.</p>

The Serbian peasants, especially women, firmly believe that saints,
parents, rulers, bishops and clergymen have the privilege of cursing and
that the person to whom the curse is addressed is bound to undergo the
consequences pronounced by the curser. There are several instances in
the Serbian heroic ballads by which it is proven that the national
Serbian bards, and indeed all the peasants who participated in the
composition of their epic poetry, believe that curses pronounced by
privileged persons always come true. Thus in the ballad <i>Uros and
Mrnjavcevici</i> King Vukasin of Macedonia, angry with his son Marko
Kralyevich because the latter, when chosen for arbiter, said that the
imperial crown belonged to Carevic Uros and not to him (Vukasin),
exclaimed:</p>

<p class=" footnote poem">
<span class="i0">"O son Marko, may God smother thee!</span>
<span class="i0">Mayest thou have no tomb, nor progeny</span>
<span class="i0">May thy soul not leave thy body</span>
<span class="i0">Before thou hast served the Turkish emperor!"</span>
</p>

<p class="footnote">While Marko's kingly father cursed him, Carevic Uros
blesses him thus:</p>

<p class=" footnote poem">
<span class="i0">"O my Kum Marko, God second thee!</span>
<span class="i0">Thy face shine at divan</span>
<span class="i0">Thy sabre smother in duels!</span>
<span class="i0">May no one excel thee in heroism</span>
<span class="i0">Thy name be reverently remembered.</span>
<span class="i0">As long as Sun and Moon shine!"</span></p>

<p class="footnote">And the bard finishes his poem with, "Whatever they
said, it came true."</p>

<p class="footnote">Another oral tradition tells us how a nobleman
<i>Velimir Bogati</i> (Velimir the Rich) who once refused hospitality to
Knez Lazar, the emperor of Serbia (1389), was cursed by the noble prince
and how Velimir's first son indeed drowned himself in the river
Lepenica, his second son fell from his horse and died in consequence of
the accident and how his third, and now only son, was imprisoned by his
father in one of the remotest towers of his castle in order to avoid any
danger of experiencing the prince's curse. One day, however, Velimir
Bogati brought to his imprisoned son some grapes from his own vineyard,
in order that the poor young fellow should at least know what time of
the year it was, and lo! while the boy was eating the grapes a small
viper jumped out of the bunch and mortally bit him. The news of the
sudden death of the young nobleman spread rapidly amongst the
neighboring villages and fortified the peasants in their belief that one
cannot escape the curse.</p>

<p class="footnote">Par extension a <i>kletva</i> (curse) can be
effective even if pronounced, as in the above song, by other persons
than those privileged.</p>

<p class="footnote">Another saga narrates how a peasant greedily coveted
and wished to appropriate a corn field that belonged to his neighbour
and, in order to attain his evil end, he buried in the middle of that
field his only son whom he had previously taught what to say when
interrogated. The judge and the plaintiffs came with the defender to the
spot and the mischievous peasant in order to mystify those present,
exclaimed: "O black earth, speak of thy own free will, to whom dost thou
rightly belong?"</p>

<p class="footnote">"I belong to thee," the voice from below was
heard.</p>

<p class="footnote">The lawful owner, hearing this, started aback. And
the judge's verdict appointed the field to belong to the covetous and
wrong claimant. And the parties dispersed in wonder.</p>

<p class="footnote">Then the father began to dig the ground in order to
disinter his son. But&mdash;there was not the shadow of one! He called
loudly and the child answered the call but the voice from beneath the
earth was ever fainter and fainter. Finally the child turned to a
mole.</p>

<p class="footnote">Thus became, according to Serbian tradition, the
first mole. (Edit.)</p>

Sir John Bowring, although a remarkable transversifier and at times a
true interpreter of popular songs of the Slavs, has taken too much of
that <i>licentia poetica</i> in his rendering of this, one of the most
beautiful lyrics ever composed by Serbian peasant women. The reader may
judge for himself, when comparing Sir John Bowring's liberal
transversification with the following <i>verbatim</i> translation (which
he, himself, felt absolutely indispensable to reproduce) what a great
injustice is inflicted upon the popular songs of any people by even the
most conscientious transversifier and how infinitely less untrue to the
original a rendering can be. (Edit.)</p>

<p class="footnote">Of this little poem, which Goethe calls "wonderful,"
the following is an almost literal translation:</p>

<p class="poem footnote">
<span class="i0">Full of wine, white branches of the vine-trees</span>
<span class="i0">To white Buda's fortress white had clung them:</span>
<span class="i0">No! it was no vine-tree, white and pregnant!</span>
<span class="i0">No! it was a pair of faithful lovers,</span>
<span class="i0">From their early youth betrothed together.</span>
<span class="i0">Now they are compell'd to part untimely.</span>
<span class="i0">One address'd the other at their parting,</span>
<span class="i0">"Go! my soul! burst out and leave my bosom!</span>
<span class="i0">Thou wilt find a hedge-surrounded garden,</span>
<span class="i0">And a red-rose branch within the garden;</span>
<span class="i0">Pluck a rose from off the branch, and place it,</span>
<span class="i0">Place it on thy heart, within thy bosom;</span>
<span class="i0">Then behold!&mdash;ev'n as that rose is fading,</span>
<span class="i0">Fades my heart within thy heart thou loved one!"</span>
<span class="i0">And thus answer'd then the other lover:</span>
<span class="i0">"Thou, my soul! turn back a few short paces.</span>
<span class="i0">There thou wilt discern a verdant forest;</span>
<span class="i0">In it is a fount of crystal water;</span>
<span class="i0">In the fount there is a block of marble;</span>
<span class="i0">On the marble block a golden goblet;</span>
<span class="i0">In the goblet thou wilt find a snow-ball.</span>
<span class="i0">Love! take out that snow-ball from the goblet,</span>
<span class="i0">Lay it on thy heart within thy bosom;</span>
<span class="i0">See it melt&mdash;and as it melts, my lov'd one!</span>
<span class="i0">So my heart within thy heart is melting."</span>

This song is sung at the close of the harvest, when all the reapers are
gathered together. Half as many reeds as the number of persons present
are so bound that no one can distinguish the two ends which belong to
the same reed. Each man takes one end of the reeds on one side, each of
the women takes one end at the other. The withes that bind the reeds are
severed, and the couples that hold the same reed kiss one another. (S.

<i>Musko cedo</i> (male child). The male sex is in Serbia, as elsewhere,
deemed entitled to more care and attention than the other. (S. J.

As unfortunately Serbian parents often, very often, select the husband
of their marriageable daughter, the poor girl, unless disobedient and
rebellious, meekly accedes to the choice even if her bridegroom should
be an old man. This is obviously a remnant of Turkish dominion in
Serbia. (Edit.)</p>

The leech, <i>Sanguisuga</i>; but in Serbian there is no disagreeable
association with the word. It is the name usually employed to describe
the beauty of the eyebrows, as swallows' wings are the simile used for
eyelashes. (S. J. B.)</p>

As the Serbians have had during the long Ottoman rule to attend to much
sterner duties than that of cultivating literature and art, and, as the
greater part of the population (sixty per cent at least) are even to
this day completely illiterate, ability to read and write is still
considered an 'art' with the peasantry. (Edit.)</p>

The cuckoo (<i>Kukavica</i>), according to Serbian tradition, was a
maiden who mourned so unceasingly for a dead brother, that she was
changed into a bird, and thence continues without rest her melancholy
note. A Serbian girl who has lost a brother never hears a cuckoo without
shedding tears.&mdash;"I a poor cuckoo," is equivalent to "woe is me!"

<i>Ban</i> is obviously a corrupt form of the Polish or Cech or
Ruthenian title <i>Pan</i>, meaning "Mr." or, in direct address, "Sir."
To this day that word has been conserved only by those Serbians who have
lived in the Austro-Hungarian territory called Croatia, and is applied
as a title to their political chief. (Edit.)</p>

 <a href="#fnanchor_27">[27]</a>
Lado is the vocative of <i>Lada</i>, the goddess of love, in the old
Slavonian mythology. <i>Lado!</i> is a melancholy interjection in
Serbian, whereas <i>Lele!</i> the vocative of Lela, the god of love, has
frequently a cheerful association. <i>Polela</i> (after love) the
goddess of marriage, is also sometimes apostrophised. Talvj remarks,
that <i>Ljad</i>, in Russian, signifies misfortune. In common parlance,
<i>Lele mene</i> (Serbian) imports "Woe is me!" (S. J. B.)</p>

 <a href="#fnanchor_29">[29]</a>
Wesely imagines that this expression has been introduced into Serbian
poetry by the influence of the interesting ballad on the marriage of
Maxim Cernojevic (see <i>Quarterly Review</i> for December, 1826). The
intimate intercourse which existed between Serbia and Venice may account
for the phraseology. (S. J. B.)</p>

<i>Kolo</i>, signifying literally a wheel, is the generic term for all
the Serbian national dances in most of which the dancers, either taking
hands, or united each to each by a handkerchief tied round the waist or
to the girdle, form a ring and advance or retreat to and from the centre
to a monotonous music, either of the voice or some very simple wind
instruments. Both sexes take part in these dances, which are frequently
in the open air. (O. M.)</p>

<i>Koled</i>: In ancient times the Serbians, as all the Slavs, often
used this word as a refrain in their bucolic songs. It was an address to
<i>Ledo</i>, the ancient Slav divinity who presided over the process of
fertility and protected fields and flowers. (J. W. W.)</p>

Loud lamentations, by women rather than men, are an ancient custom among
the Serbs. These dirges are again and again extemporized with
spontaneous poetic feeling. Girls let down their hair and lament in the
orchards and precincts of the house. (J. W. W.)</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
